# Taj Security Agency Homepage

***Work In Progress***

This is a single page website that I did for dad's security agency sometime back. Now being rewritten in react & semantic-ui.

__To Do__
- [ ] clean up the css, remove unnecesary style rules
- [ ] Get rid of the jquery/ rewrite components in vanilla js/es6
- [ ] Rewrite static-site with react, gatsby & semantic-ui
- [ ] Add a markdown generated static blog
- [ ] Create an email server/ contact form with Koa, Nodemailer & Tellform
- [ ] Create rest-API server/client, access security data over open APIs/ public dataset & display on site
- [ ] Lint the javascript, clean up css, minimize all files, ensure site HTML5 compliant/ accessible, create amp version, tune site speed
