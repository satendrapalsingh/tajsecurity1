# Taj Security Agency Homepage

***Work In Progress***

This is a single page website that I did for Taj Security Agency sometime back. 

The master branch will host the node/server-side rendered app on heroku.

The static branch will host live site (generated static site version) on AWS-S3 at domain http://tajsecurity.in/

This repository hosts the development version, now being rewritten in react, gatsby, next.js, pug, less, express & semantic-ui.

__To Do__
- [ ] Clean up the css, remove unnecesary style rules
- [ ] Get rid of the jquery/ rewrite components in vanilla js/es6
- [ ] Rewrite static-site in react, pug, less, gatsby & semantic-ui
- [ ] Add a markdown generated static blog
- [ ] Create an email server/ contact form with Express, Nodemailer & Tellform
- [ ] Create rest-API server/client, access security data over open APIs/ public dataset & display on site
- [ ] Convert site into a server-side-rendered SPA with next.js
- [ ] Lint the javascript, clean up css, minimize all files, ensure site HTML5 compliant/ accessible, create amp version, tune site speed
